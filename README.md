# Simple React Calculator

## definition
In this project, I want to try to build a Calculator app with React.

## Characteristics
The characteristics would be as follows:
- User can see a display showing the current number entered or the result of the last operation
- User can see and intereact with buttons (the digits 0-9, operations '+', '-', '*', '/' and '=', a 'C' button for clear and 'AC' button for clear all).
- User can enter numbers as sequences up to 8 digits long. Entry of any digits more than 8 will be ignored.
